As pointed out by I.J. Good in 1965, designing smarter AI systems is itself a cognitive task. Such a system could potentially undergo recursive self-improvement, triggering an intelligence explosion leaving human intellect far behind. By inventing revolutionary new technologies, such a superintelligence might help us eradicate war, disease, and poverty, and so the creation of strong AI might be the biggest event in human history. Some experts have expressed concern, though, that it might also be the last, unless we learn to align the goals of the AI with ours before it becomes superintelligent.</p>

<h2><font color="brown">Artificial Intelligence’s Increasing Relevance</font></h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence’s growing popularity in the 21st century is largely due to the advancements in the sub-field of machine learning. Machine learning develops systems that improve upon themselves, which is accomplished through the identification of algorithms. Some processes that machine learning optimizes include paperwork automation, forensic accounting, and algorithmic trading.</p>
<h2><font color="brown">How is Machine Learning Achieved?</font></h2>
<p>The easiest way to understand how a machine becomes intelligent with AI is to compare it to how humans learn. For example, consider a child learning how to ride a bicycle. The child mounts the bicycle, grips the handlebars, and hopes to stay upright and in control. The child does not learn how to ride a bike by understanding the physics of biking, but rather through trial and error.
